# Interface

This is the public interface that day-to-day users of AD are expected to interact with if
for some reason DifferentiationInterface.jl does not suffice.
If you have not tried using Mooncake.jl via DifferentiationInterface.jl, please do so.
See [Tutorial](@ref) for more info.

Mooncake.value_and_pullback!!(::Mooncake.Cache, ȳ, f::F, x::Vararg{Any, N}) where {F, N}
Mooncake.prepare_gradient_cache
