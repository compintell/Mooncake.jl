# Performance-only rules. These should be able to be removed, and everything still works,
# just a bit slower. The effect of these is typically to remove many nodes from the tape.
# Ideally, it would be the case that acitivty analysis eliminates any run-time improvements
# that these rules provide. Possibly they would still be useful in order to avoid having to
# deduce that these bits of code are inactive though.
