# Known Limitations

Mooncake.jl has a number of known qualitative limitations, which we document here.

## Coverage of Julia Syntax and Standard Library

While `Mooncake.jl` should now work on a very large subset of the language, there remain things that you should expect not to work. A non-exhaustive list of things to bear in mind includes:
1. It is always necessary to produce hand-written rules for `ccall`s (and, more generally, foreigncall nodes). We have rules for many `ccall`s, but not all. If you encounter a foreigncall without a hand-written rule, you should get an informative error message which tells you what is going on and how to deal with it.
1. Builtins which require rules. The vast majority of them have rules now, but some don't. You should get a sensible error if you encounter a primitive without a rule.
1. Anything involving tasks / threading -- we have no thread safety guarantees and, at the time of writing, I'm not entirely sure what error you will find if you attempt to AD through code which uses Julia's task / thread system. The same applies to distributed computing. These limitations ought to be possible to resolve.

## Mutation of Global Variables

```@meta
DocTestSetup = quote
    using Mooncake
    using Mooncake: NoTangent, build_rrule
end
```

While great care is taken in this package to prevent silent errors, this is one edge case that we have yet to provide a satisfactory solution for.
Consider a function of the form:
```jldoctest bad_globalref
julia> const x = Ref(1.0);

julia> function foo(y::Float64)
           x[] = y
           return x[]
       end
foo (generic function with 1 method)
```
`x` is a global variable (if you refer to it in your code, it appears as a `GlobalRef` in the AST or lowered code).
For some technical reasons that are beyond the scope of this section, this package cannot propagate gradient information through `x`.
`foo` is the identity function, so it should have gradient `1.0`.
However, if you differentiate this example, you'll see:
```jldoctest bad_globalref
julia> rule = Mooncake.build_rrule(foo, 2.0);

julia> Mooncake.value_and_gradient!!(rule, foo, 2.0)
(2.0, (NoTangent(), 0.0))
```
Observe that while it has correctly computed the identity function, the gradient is zero.

The takehome: do not attempt to differentiate functions which modify global state. Uses of globals which does not involve mutating them is fine though.

## Circular References

To a large extent, Mooncake.jl does not presently support circular references in an automatic fashion.
It is generally possible to hand-write solutions, so we explain some of the problems here, and the general approach to resolving them.

### Tangent Types

_**The Problem**_

Suppose that you have a type such as:
```julia
mutable struct A
    x::Float64
    a::A
    function A(x::Float64)
        a = new(x)
        a.a = a
        return a
    end
end
```

This is a fairly canonical example of a self-referential type.
There are a couple of things which will not work with it out-of-the-box.
`tangent_type(A)` will produce a stack overflow error.
To see this, note that it will in effect try to produce a tangent of type `Tangent{Tuple{tangent_type(A)}}` -- the circular dependency on the `tangent_type` function causes real problems here.

_**The Solution**_

In order to resolve this, you need to produce a tangent type by hand.
You might go with something like
```julia
mutable struct TangentForA
    x::Float64 # tangent type for Float64 is Float64
    a::TangentForA
    function TangentForA(x::Float64)
        a = new(x)
        a.a = a
        return a
    end
end
```
The point here is that you can manually resolve the circular dependency using a data structure which mimics the primal type.
You will, however, need to implement similar methods for `zero_tangent`, `randn_tangent`, etc, and presumably need to implement additional `getfield` and `setfield` rules which are specific to this type.
An example implementation of this is provided [here](developer_documentation/custom_tangent_type.md).

### Circular References in General

_**The Problem**_

Consider a type of the form
```julia
mutable struct Foo
    x
    Foo() = new()
end
```
In this instance, `tangent_type` will work fine because `Foo` does not directly reference itself in its definition.
Moreover, general uses of `Foo` will be fine.

However, it's possible to construct an instance of `Foo` with a circular reference:
```julia
f = Foo()
f.x = f
```
This is actually fine provided we never attempt to call `zero_tangent` / `randn_tangent` / similar functionality on `f` once we've set its `x` field to itself.
If we attempt to call such a function, we'll find ourselves with a stack overflow.

_**The Solution**_
This is a little tricker to handle.
You could specialise `zero_tangent` etc for `Foo`, but this is something of a pain.
Fortunately, it seems to be incredibly rare that this is ever a problem in practice.
If we gain evidence that this _is_ often a problem in practice, we'll look into supporting `zero_tangent` etc automatically for this case.


## Tangent Generation and Pointers

_**The Problem**_


In many use cases, a pointer provides the address of the start of a block of memory which has been allocated to e.g. store an array.
However, we cannot get any of this context from the pointer itself -- by just looking at a pointer, I cannot know whether its purpose is to refer to the start of a large block of memory, some proportion of the way through a block of memory, or even to keep track of a single address.

Recall that the tangent to a pointer is another pointer:
```jldoctest
julia> Mooncake.tangent_type(Ptr{Float64})
Ptr{Float64}
```
Plainly I cannot implement a method of `zero_tangent` for `Ptr{Float64}` because I don't know how much memory to allocate.

This is, however, fine if a pointer appears half way through a function, having been derived from another data structure. e.g.
```jldoctest
function foo(x::Vector{Float64})
    p = pointer(x, 2)
    return unsafe_load(p)
end

rule = build_rrule(Tuple{typeof(foo), Vector{Float64}})
Mooncake.value_and_gradient!!(rule, foo, [5.0, 4.0])

# output
(4.0, (NoTangent(), [0.0, 1.0]))
```

_**The Solution**_

This is only really a problem for tangent / fdata / rdata generation functionality, such as `zero_tangent`.
As a work-around, AD testing functionality permits users to pass in `CoDual`s.
So if you are testing something involving a pointer, you will need to construct its tangent yourself, and pass a `CoDual` to e.g. `Mooncake.TestUtils.test_rule`.

While pointers tend to be a low-level implementation detail in Julia code, you could in principle actually be interested in differentiating a function of a pointer.
In this case, you will not be able to use `Mooncake.value_and_gradient!!` as this requires the use of `zero_tangent`.
Instead, you will need to use lower-level (internal) functionality, such as `Mooncake.__value_and_gradient!!`, or use the rule interface directly.

Honestly, your best bet is just to avoid differentiating functions whose arguments are pointers if you can.

```@meta
DocTestSetup = nothing
```
