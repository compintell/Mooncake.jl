"""
    DebugRRule(rule)

Construct a callable which is equivalent to `rule`, but inserts additional type checking.
In particular:
- check that the fdata in each argument is of the correct type for the primal
- check that the fdata in the `CoDual` returned from the rule is of the correct type for the
    primal.

This happens recursively.
For example, each element of a `Vector{Any}` is compared against each element of the
associated fdata to ensure that its type is correct, as this cannot be guaranteed from the
static type alone.

Some additional dynamic checks are also performed (e.g. that an fdata array of the same size
as its primal).

Let `rule` return `y, pb!!`, then `DebugRRule(rule)` returns `y, DebugPullback(pb!!)`.
`DebugPullback` inserts the same kind of checks as `DebugRRule`, but on the reverse-pass. See
the docstring for details.

*Note:* at any given point in time, the checks performed by this function constitute a
necessary but insufficient set of conditions to ensure correctness. If you find that an
error isn't being caught by these tests, but you believe it ought to be, please open an
issue or (better still) a PR.
